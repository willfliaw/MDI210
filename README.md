# Optimization and Numerical Analysis (MDI210) - 2023/2024

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials and resources for the course **MDI210: Optimization and Numerical Analysis**, part of the **Informatics** curriculum. The course covers two key topics: continuous optimization and numerical analysis. Students will learn methods for solving optimization problems, both with and without constraints, as well as techniques for solving linear systems and calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Key Topics:

- Continuous Optimization: Methods for finding minima and maxima of functions on subsets of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), with or without constraints.
- Numerical Analysis: Techniques for solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and eigenvector computation.
- Practical Exercises: Implementations using C-based programs to apply optimization and numerical methods.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have:
- Basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra
- Familiarity with programming, particularly in C

## Course Structure

- Total Hours: 24 hours of in-person sessions (16 sessions), including:
  - 3 hours of knowledge assessments (written exams)
  - 15 hours of lectures
  - 6 hours of practical work
- Estimated Self-Study: 38.5 hours
- Credits: 2.5 ECTS
- Evaluation: Written exam (3 hours) with no calculator allowed. A 2-sided A4 sheet and a paper dictionary are allowed for non-French speakers.

## Instructor

- Professor Olivier Hudry

## Installation and Setup

For practical exercises in this course, we will use Java and the Eclipse IDE. You can follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK):
   Download and install the JDK from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Install Eclipse IDE:
   Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [Eclipse's official site](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
3. Set up your Eclipse Workspace:
   - Open Eclipse and select a workspace folder.
   - Create a new Java project: `File > New > Java Project`.
   - Add your source files and begin coding.
4. Run Java Programs in Eclipse:
   - To run your program, right-click the source file in the Project Explorer and select `Run As > Java Application`.

This setup will allow you to complete practical exercises related to optimization and numerical analysis using Java.
