- `java -jar executableDescent.jar. `
- Solutions:
  - Pb1: 1 in (0, 0)
  - Pb2: 0 in (0, 0) with zigzag oscillations (no constraint)
  - Pb3: no min
  - Pb4: -1,946 in (1, 3) on a corner
  - Pb5: -1,25 in (1,5, -0,5) ; interesting to start for example from (0,1, 3) : it comes on the vertical contraint, then goes down to the corner and then goes and stops on the other constraint (where the minimum is located)
  - Pb6: 1 in (0, 1)
  - Pb7: -5,33 in (2,67, -1,33)
  - Pb8: 19,642 in (2,178, 1,823)
  - Pb9: 0,483 in (0,737, 0,263)
  - Pb10: no min (no constraint)
  - Pb11: no min
  - Pb12: 0 in (5, 2) spiral convergence
  - Pb13: 0 in (0, 0)
  - Pb14: 7,7 in (1,60, -1,40)
